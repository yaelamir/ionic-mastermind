## Identify Teams/Sub-teams

### Identify Teams

Your teams will consist of your current stand up groups.

### Identify Sub-teams

To improve your workflow, consider breaking your team into two sub-teams as follows:

- HTML/CSS
  - This team will write all of the code in the HTML and CSS files.
  - This includes coding all Angular directives for binding, click handlers, etc.

- JavaScript
	- This team will be responsible for all of the code in the script files.

### Document the "Code Contract" Between Views & Controller

- Because the views/templates in AngularJS bind to properties and methods in the controller, it is important to establish what those properties/methods will be named and what they do.

- Document what you can before you start to code, then add and revise the contract as you go.

## Review Specs of Game - Mastermind

### Demo

View a quick demo of the game.

### Rules

The rules of the game are simple:

- The computer will generate a random "secret" code consisting of four of the icons in the footer bar. There may be zero or up to four of an icon (steep odds, but possible).
- The player tries to crack the secret code by making guesses, having the computer score them, and revising future guesses based upon the score of prior guesses.
- Guesses are formed by clicking any of the four positions, which will place the currently active icon, shown in the footer bar, in that location.
- Click any of the icons in the footer bar to make it the active icon.
- The player wins when they have cracked the code.

## Review Starter Code

- Starter code has been provided.
- The application has one Angular controller and three templates - all of which require some code modifications.
- Several `TODO` comments have been sprinkled around the files to help guide you.
- One of the first things your team should do is spend a little time familiarizing yourselves with the starter code and `TODO` comments. Doing so will pay dividends.

## Git/GitHub Workflow

- One team member should establish a local git and GitHub remote repository.
- For this particular exercise, feel free to use the "shared repository" model whereby the other teammates are added as collaborators. This model can be more "efficient" for small teams working on a tight deadline.
- Using this model, teammates clone the repo instead of forking it and will have read/write access to the GitHub repo.
- All team member/collaborators should:
   - Create their own feature branches.
   - Commit changes to the branch.
   - Push the feature branch to the repo (`? git push origin my-feature`).
   - Issue a pull request.
   - Be aware that any collaborator has the ability to merge pull requests. Even the team member that made the request can merge it, but this would not be considered a best practice.
   - Be aware that all collaborators are able to push to the `master` branch  (but should never do so).
   - Never commit code that breaks the app!
   - Whenever notified of changes to the remote's `master` branch, merge changes into their local repo:

   ```
   ? git checkout master
   ? git pull
   ```
   
   This will ensure that a collaborator's local `master` branch is in sync with the remote's `master` (the app's production code).
   
   - Then, to ensure that you are lessening the chance of merge conflicts, you should merge your newly updated local `master` branch with your current feature branch:

   ```
   ? git checkout my-feature
   ? git merge master
   ```

## Code Away!

This app has some functionality that requires coding game logic, for example, scoring a turn. It's recommended that you pseudocode possible approaches.

Remember the AngularJS Mindset - drive your app with data and data-binding!

Have fun!

We'll review your solutions towards the end of the lesson.
